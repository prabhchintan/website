Hi, I'm Prabhchintan Randhawa. I was born and raised in Punjab, India and currently live in Austin, Texas. I run a bootstrapped digital asset custodian startup selling engineering, technical consulting, Ethereum staking, domain brokerage, and product management services. Previously I've worked at companies like Shell and Apple for roughly a decade. I like to make music in my free time. Following is my Twitter feed:
